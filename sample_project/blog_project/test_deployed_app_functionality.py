"""Test functionality of the blog project after it's been deployed.

** The main goal is test the deployment process, not to test the app itself. **

The goal is to cover all core functionality, without over-testing.
- This test is usually run against a deployed project, with over-network
  load times. Thorough testing would take an excessively long time. So,
  if a core aspect of the project has been tested already, there's no need
  to test that aspect in other pages.
- So, we test creation of blogs and posts because that proves that db access 
  is working. But we don't need to test editing and deletion.
- This test script assumes an empty db. It also will fail if run twice without flushing,
  because it will try to create the same user a second time.

Overall testing approach:
- Test anonymous views of some pages before any data has been created.
- Create a user.
- Create some data, and check views for the owner.
- Test the logout process.
- Verify public data is visible to anon user.
- Verify private data is not visible to anon user.

Usage:
- Run locally, and flush db before running tests:
  $ python test_deployed_app_functionality.py --url http://localhost:8000/ --flush-db
- Run against freshly-pushed project:
  $ python test_deployed_app_functionality.py --url deployed_project_url
