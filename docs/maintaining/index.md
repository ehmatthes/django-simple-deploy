Maintaining a project is distinct from contributing to a project. A maintainer merges PRs, makes releases, and manages issues and discussions. Some of these tasks need to be documented so that things are done appropriately, consistently, and transparently.

Currently, there is only one maintainer of this project. I'm looking to build a small group of maintainers, as my long-term goal is that this project belongs to the community. A maintainer needs to  understand the technical tasks of merging PRs and managing issues, but also needs to be really clear about discussing, navigating, and defining the boundaries of this project.

Python packaging can be consuing, because there are many different approaches that can be taken. It's a rapidly evolving space in its own right. I want to document the processes used for packaging this project, and be ready to adopt newly emerging best practices around packaging. If you're experienced in package management and have feedback about the processes you see here, please feel free to share your thoughts.
